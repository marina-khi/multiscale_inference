Description: This package performs a multiscale analysis of a nonparametric
  regression or nonparametric regressions with time series errors. In case
  of one regression, it is possible to detect where the trend function is
  increasing or decresing. In case of multiple regression, the test identifies
  regions where the trend functions are different from each other. See
  Khismatullina and Vogt (2019) for more information and theory.
