Description: This package performs a multiscale analysis of a nonparametric
  regression with time series errors or nonparametric regressions. In case
  of one regression, it is possible to detect where the trend function is
  increasing or decreasing. In case of multiple regression, the test identifies
  regions where the trend functions are different from each other. See
  Khismatullina and Vogt (2019) and Khismatullina and Vogt (2020)
  for more information and theory.
