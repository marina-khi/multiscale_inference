\usage{
compute_statistics(
  data,
  sigma,
  n_ts = 1,
  grid = NULL,
  ijset = NULL,
  deriv_order = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Vector (in case of n_ts = 1) or matrix (in case of
n_ts > 1) that contains (a number of) time series
that needs to be analyzed. In the latter case,
each column of the matrix must contain one time series.}

\item{sigma}{An estimator of the square root of the long-run
variance (\eqn{\widehat{\sigma}}) in case of n_ts = 1,
or estimator of the overdispersion parameter
(\eqn{\widehat{\sigma}}) in case of n_ts > 1.}

\item{n_ts}{Number of time series analysed. Default is 1.}

\item{grid}{Grid of location-bandwidth points as produced by
the function \code{\link{construct_grid}} or
\code{\link{construct_weekly_grid}}, it is a list with
the elements 'gset', 'bws', 'gtype'. If not provided,
then the defalt grid is produced and used.
For the construction of the default grid,
see \code{\link{construct_grid}}.}

\item{ijset}{In case of multiple time series (n_ts > 1),
we need to know which pairs of time series to compare.
This matrix consists of all pairs of indices \eqn{(i, j)}
that we want to compare. If not provided, then all
possible pairwise comparison are performed.}

\item{deriv_order}{In case of a single time series, this denotes the order of
the derivative of the trend that we estimate.
Default is 0.}
}
\value{
In case of n_ts = 1:

stat           Value of the multiscale statistics.

gset_with_vals A matrix that contains the values of the normalised 
                       kernel averages for each pair of location-bandwidth
                       with the corresponding location and bandwidth.

In case of n_ts > 1:

stat           Value of the multiscale statistics.

stat_pairwise  Matrix of the values of the pairwise statistics.

ijset          The matrix that  consists of all pairs of indices
                       \eqn{(i, j)} that we compared. The order of these
                       pairs corresponds to the order in the list
                       gset_with_vals.

gset_with_vals A list of matrices, each matrix corresponding to a 
                       specific pairwise comparison. The order of the list 
                       is determined by ijset. Each matrix contains
                       the values of the normalisedkernel averages
                       for each pair of location-bandwidth
                       with the corresponding location and bandwidth.
