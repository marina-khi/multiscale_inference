\title{Computes the location-bandwidth grid for the multiscale test.}
\usage{
construct_grid(t, u_grid = NULL, h_grid = NULL, deletions = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Sample size.}

\item{u_grid}{Vector of location points in the unit interval [0,1].
If u.grid = NULL, a default grid is used.}

\item{h_grid}{Vector of bandwidths, each bandwidth is supposed to lie
in \eqn{(0, 0.5)}. If h.grid = NULL, a default grid is used.}

\item{deletions}{Logical vector of the length len(u.grid) * len(h.grid).
Each element is either TRUE, which means that
the corresponding location-bandwidth point \eqn{(u, h)}
is NOT deleted from the grid, or FALSE, which means that
the corresponding location-bandwidth point \eqn{(u, h)}
IS deleted from the grid. Default is deletions = NULL
in which case nothing is deleted.
See vignette for the use.}
}
\value{
gset      Matrix of location-bandwidth points \eqn{(u, h)}
                  that remains after deletions, the i-th row gset[i,]
                  corresponds to the i-th point (u,h).

bws       Vector of bandwidths (after deletions).

lens      Vector of length = length(bws), lens[i] gives
                  the number of locations in the grid for
                  the i-th bandwidth level.

gtype     Type of grid that is used, either 'default' or
                  'non-default'.

gset_full Matrix of all location-bandwidth pairs \eqn{(u, h)}
                  including deleted ones.

pos_full  Logical vector indicating which points \eqn{(u, h)}
                  have been deleted.
