%\section{Summary} 


%The comparison of trend curves is an important topic in many statistical applications. In economics, one may be interested in comparing the trends in the long-term interest rates of different countries. Similarly, one may want to find out whether there are different trends in real GDP growth for different countries. In finance, large amounts of data on a huge number of stocks ara available nowadays. One may want to compare wherther there the volatility trend is different for different stocks. In climatotology, large spatial data sets have been collected which comprise long temperature time series for many different spatial locations. Climatologists are very much interested in analsing the trending behaviour of these time series. In particular, they would like to know how the trending behaviour varies with the location. 


%The main aim of this project is to develop new methods and theory for the comparison of nonparametric trend curves. Classically, time trends are modelled stochastically in econometrics, e.g.\ by a unit root model. Recently, there has been a growing interest in models with a detemrinsitic time trend. An interesting modelling framework considered in ?? among others is as follows: Suppose we observe a number of time series $\mathcal{Y}_i = \{ Y_{it}: 1 \le t \le T \}$ for $1 \le i \le n$. Each time series $\mathcal{Y}_i$ is modelled by the equation
%\begin{equation}\label{model}
%Y_{it} = m_i \Big( \frac{t}{T} \Big) + \beta_i^\top X_{it} + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it}
%\end{equation}
%for $1 \le t \le T$, where $m_i$ is a nonparametric trend curve, $X_{it} = (X_{it,1},\ldots,X_{it,d})$ is a $d$-dimensional vector of regressors or controls and $\beta_i$ is the corresponding parameter vector, $\alpha_i$ are so-called fixed effect error terms and $\varepsilon_{it}$ are standard regression errors with $\ex[\varepsilon_{it}] = 0$ for all $t$. 


%Within model \eqref{model}, one may consider several interesting statistical questions. The first one is the following: Are all time trends $m_i$ the same? That is, do all time series in the sample exhibit the same tending behaviour. This question can be approached formally as a testing problem. The null hypothesis is of interest can be formulated as $H_0: m_1 = \ldots = m_n$. [Literature on comparison of trend curves and more generally of regression curves.]

%The main aim of this project is to develop new methods for the comparison and clustering of nonparametric curves. Depending on the application context, the curves of interest are densities, distribution, quantile or regression functions. We focus attention to the regression context. In particular, we consider a model with nonparametric regression functions which can be interpreted as nonparametric time trend curves. Since Stock and Watson (1988), there has been in particular a large literature in econometrics on testing for common trends. Our project aims to introduce and establish novel methods for the comparison of trend curves which are superior to existing methods in at least two respects: (a) Unlike the great bulk of existing methods, the proposed procedures are free of classical smoothing or bandwidth parameters that are notoriously difficult to select in practice. (b) The methods are much more informative than standard tests. They do not only allow to test whether the curves of interest are different. They also allow It also allows to detect, with a given statistical confidence, which time curves are different and in which regions of the support they differ. Based on our test method, we further construct an algorithm which clusters the observed time series into groups with the same trend.

\section{State of the art and preliminary work}


The comparison of trend curves is an important topic in many statistical applications. Economists, for example, are interested in comparing the trends of long-term interest rates for different countries. Moreover, they may want to assess whether there are different trends in real GDP growth across countries. In finance, massive amounts of data on thousands of stocks are available today. One question of interest is to compare how the volatility of different stocks evolves over time. Finally, in climatotology, large spatial data sets have been collected which comprise long temperature time series for many different locations. Climatologists are very much interested in analyzing the trending behaviour of these time series. In particular, they would like to know how the temperature trend varies across locations. 


The main aim of this project is to develop new methods and theory for the comparison of nonparametric trend curves. Classically, time trends are modelled stochastically in econometrics, e.g.\ by a unit root model [see ??]. Recently, there has been a growing interest in models with deterministic time trends [see ??]. An interesting modelling framework considered in ?? among others is as follows: Suppose we observe a number of time series $\mathcal{Y}_i = \{ Y_{it}: 1 \le t \le T \}$ for $1 \le i \le n$. Each time series $\mathcal{Y}_i$ is modelled by the equation
\begin{equation}\label{model}
Y_{it} = m_i \Big( \frac{t}{T} \Big) + \beta_i^\top X_{it} + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
for $1 \le t \le T$, where $m_i$ is a nonparametric trend curve, $X_{it} = (X_{it,1},\ldots,X_{it,d})$ is a $d$-dimensional vector of regressors or controls and $\beta_i$ is the corresponding parameter vector, $\alpha_i$ are so-called fixed effect error terms and $\varepsilon_{it}$ are standard regression errors with $\ex[\varepsilon_{it}] = 0$ for all $t$.  Within model \eqref{model}, one may approach several interesting statistical questions.
\vspace{15pt}


\noindent \textit{(a) Testing for equality of nonparametric trend curves. } 
\vspace{10pt} 

 
\noindent The first question is the following: Are all time trends $m_i$ the same? That is, do all time series in the sample exhibit the same trending behaviour? This question can be approached formally by means of a statistical test. The null hypothesis can be formulated as $H_0: m_1 = \ldots = m_n$.

\end{itemize}


Most tests of the hypothesis $H_0: m_1 = \ldots = m_n$ existing in the literature proceed in two steps: They first estimate the curves of interest by nonparametric methods and then construct a distance measure between the estimated curves which serves as a test statistic. By construction, these tests depend on one or several smoothing parameters which are needed to estimate the curves $m_i$. However, there is no theory available for a proper choice of the bandwidth/smoothing parameter. In particular, the optimal (MSE minimizing) bandwidth used for curve fitting is usually not optimal for testing. A classical way to get a bandwidth-free test statistic is to use empirical process theory and partial sum processes [cp.\ Hidalgo \& Lee (2014)]. A more modern way which is related to these partial sum processes are so-called multiscale tests. The idea is as follows: ?? 


Multiscale tests for the comparison of nonparametric curves under general conditions are not available to the best of our knowledge. One aim of the project is to develop such a test for nonparametric regression curves. Multiscale tests do not only have the advantage of being bandwidth-free. They also are much more informative compared to other tests. They do not only allow to test whether the curves $m_i$ are all the same or not. They also allow to say, with a pre-specified statistical confidence, which curves are different and in which regions they differ.  
\vspace{15pt}


\noindent \textit{(b) Clustering of nonparametric trend curves. } 
\vspace{10pt} 


%Testing the equality of nonparametric curves is a classical theme in econometrics and statistics. In the simplest setting, two data sets $\mathcal{D}_i = \{ (Y_{it},X_{it}): 1 \le t \le T \}$ for $i=1,2$ are observed, where $T$ denotes the sample size of each data set. The data are supposed to come from the model 
%\begin{equation}\label{model-1}
%Y_{it} = m_i(X_{it}) + \varepsilon_{it}, 
%\end{equation}
%where $m_i$ denotes the unknown (nonparametric) regression function for each data set and $\varepsilon_{it}$ is the error term. The aim is to construct a statistical test for the hypothesis $H_0: m_1 = m_2$ that the two regression curves are equal. A number of tests have been proposed for this problem. ??

%(1) A classical theme in econometrics and statistics is the comparison of nonparametric curves. In many applications, the curves of interest can be interpreted as (determinstic or stochastic) trends. Starting with Stock and Watson (1988), there has been a growing literature in econometrics on testing for common trends [good summary in the introduction of Zhang, Su, Phillips (2012)):

%\item Xu (2011). Robustifying multivariate trend tests to nonstationary volatility.
%\item Zhang, Su \& Phillips (2012). Testing for common trends in semi-parametric panel data models with fixed effects.
%\end{itemize}

\noindent When the number of curves is large, classical tests for the comparison of nonparametric curves are not fully appropriate as a statistical tool. The issue is the following: In most applications where the number of curves is large, one can expect that not all curves are exactly the same. Hence, a test of the null that all curves are the same is quite uninformative. Most frequently, the hypothesis will be rejected. A more interesting question is the following: Are there groups of curves that are the same? This question leads to the problem of curve clustering. Clustering of coefficient or functions in panel data models is a relative young emerging field in econometrics:

interactive fixed effects.
\item Wang, Phillips, \& Su (2018). Homogeneity pursuit in panel data models: theory and application.
\end{itemize}
In the statistics literature, there is also a literature on curve clustering (functional and longitudinal data):

\item Degras, Xu, Zhang, \& Wu (2012). Testing for parallelism among trends in multiple time series.
\end{itemize}
Most of the clustering procedures in the literature depend on a number of smoothing parameters. Multiscale approaches do not.

\subsection{Objectives}


The main aim of the project is to develop new methods and theory for the comparison and clustering of nonparametric curves. We intend to consider the following model framework: Suppose we observe a number of time series $\mathcal{Y}_i = \{ Y_{it}: 1 \le t \le T \}$ for $1 \le i \le n$. Each time series $\mathcal{Y}_i$ is modelled by the equation
\begin{equation}\label{model-objectives}
Y_{it} = m_i \Big( \frac{t}{T} \Big) + \beta_i^\top X_{it} + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
for $1 \le t \le T$, where $m_i$ is a nonparametric trend curve, $X_{it} = (X_{it,1},\ldots,X_{it,d})$ is a $d$-dimensional vector of regressors or controls, $\alpha_i$ are so-called fixed effect error terms and $\varepsilon_{it}$ are standard regression errors with $\ex[\varepsilon_{it}] = 0$ for all $t$. As usual in nonparametric regression, we let $m_i$ depend on rescaled time $t/T$ rather than real time $t$; compare ??, ?? and ?? among many others for the use of the rescaled time argument. For simplicity, the controls $X_{it}$ are assumed to enter the model equation linearly with $\beta_i$ being the corresponding parameter vector. However, it is possible to extend the model to allow for nonlinear parametric and even nonparametric specifications of $X_{it}$. [Conditions on the fixed effects and the error terms.] 


The first main contribution of the project is to contruct a novel multiscale test for the comparison of the trend curves $m_i$ ($1 \le i \le n$). Compared to existing methods, the approach has the following main advantages: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*),leftmargin=0.75cm]
\item 
\item 
\end{enumerate}
To the best of our knoweledge, there is no other multiscale method available in the literature. The only exception is ?? who have developed theory for the case $n=2$. However, the theory is developed under severe restrictions: ??.   
We do not only aim to develop methodology but also derive a complete asymptotic theory for the proposed multiscale test. In particular, we will derive the limit distribution and analyse the behaviour under (local) alternatives. 


The second main contribution is to develop a clustering approach which is based on the multiscale test from the first main part of the project. The only multiscale clusetering method available in the literature is Vogt \& Linton (2018). They consider a very general nonparametric regression model but only derive consistency results for the clustering method. We consider a somewhat simpler model but will derive a complete distribution theory for the clustering method (which in particular allows to make not only converge statements but also confidence statements about the estimated groups and their number). 


Model \eqref{model-objectives} and the proposed testing/clustering method are useful in a number of application contexts which we aim to explore. We here give some examples: 
\begin{example}
Examples from \cite{Park2009}, SiZer analysis for the comparison of time series and \cite{Zhang2012}, Testing for common trends in semi-parametric panel data models with fixed effects. [Add that the analysis of climate data with econometric methods has attracted some attention in recent years and cite econometrics literature.]
\end{example}





%The main purpose of the research project is to propose a new multiscale testing and inference approach for the model which consists of multiple time series with time series error structure and in the presence of generated regressors. 

%When several time series $\mathcal{Y}_i = \{ Y_{it}: 1 \le t \le T \}$ are observed for $1 \le i \le n$, we model each time series $\mathcal{Y}_i$ by the equation
%\begin{equation}\label{model2-intro}
%Y_{it} = m_i \Big( \frac{t}{T} \Big) + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it}
%\end{equation}
%for $1 \le t \le T$, where $m_i$ is a nonparametric time trend, $\alpha_i$ is a (random or deterministic) intercept and $\varepsilon_{it}$ are time series errors with $\ex[\varepsilon_{it}] = 0$ for all $t$.

%An important question in many applications is whether the time trends $m_i$ are the same for all $i$. When some of the trends are different, there may still be groups of time series with the same trend. In this case, it is often of interest to estimate the unknown groups from the data. In addition, when two trends $m_i$ and $m_j$ are not the same, it may also be relevant to know in which time regions they differ from each other. In Section \ref{sec-test-equality}, we construct statistical methods to approach these questions. In particular, we develop a test of the hypothesis that all time trends in model \eqref{model2-intro} are the same, that is, $m_1 = m_2 = \ldots = m_n$. Similar as before, our method does not only allow to test whether the null hypothesis is violated. It also allows to detect, with a given statistical confidence, which time trends are different and in which time regions they differ from each other. Based on our test method, we further construct an algorithm which clusters the observed time series into groups with the same trend.
