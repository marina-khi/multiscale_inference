\textbf{To the Editors of JBES}
\vspace{20pt}


Dear Editors,
\vspace{7pt}

Please find attached the files for our manuscript \textit{Multiscale Comparison of Nonparametric Trend Curves}. The submission consists of the paper itself, supplementary material and a zip-folder with R-code in it which provides the code for our simulations and applications. The zip-folder includes a readme-file which explains the overall structure of the code. The supplementary material contains the proofs and technical arguments that are left out in the paper and the results of the application of our method to the data on the GDP growth.

We look forward to hearing from you!

Yours sincerely, \\
Marina Khismatullina and Michael Vogt
