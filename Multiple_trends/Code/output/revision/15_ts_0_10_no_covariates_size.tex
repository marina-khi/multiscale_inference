%This simulation was done for the following values of the parameters: n_ts = 15, with 1000 simulations for calculating size and power and 1000 simulations to calculate the Gaussian quantiles. Furthermore, for the error process we have a = 0.3 and sigma = 0.15. For the fixed effect, we have rho = 0.1. The grid is
