%This simulation was done for the seed 113355, for the following values of the parameters: n_ts = 15, with 5000 simulations for calculating size and power and 5000 simulations to calculate the Gaussian quantiles. Furthermore, for the error process we have a = 0.25 and sigma = 0.25. We do not have any covarites. For the fixed effect, we have rho = 0.1. The grid is fine (growing with the sample size)
